Basic SOQL Syntax
SELECT fields FROM ObjectName [WHERE Condition]

Filtering Query Results with Conditions
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account WHERE Name='SFDC Computing'
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees>25)
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' OR (NumberOfEmployees>25 AND BillingCity='Los Angeles'))


Ordering Query Results
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account ORDER BY Name
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account ORDER BY Name DESC


SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account 
                   WHERE (Name = 'SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees>25)
                   ORDER BY Name
                   LIMIT 10





Accessing Variables in SOQL Queries
String targetDepartment = 'Wingo';
Contact[] techContacts = [SELECT FirstName,LastName 
                          FROM Contact WHERE Department=:targetDepartment];
						  


Querying Related Records
SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'


Account[] acctsWithContacts = [SELECT Name, (SELECT FirstName,LastName FROM Contacts)
                               FROM Account 
                               WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'];
// Get child records
Contact[] cts = acctsWithContacts[0].Contacts;
System.debug('Name of first associated contact: ' 
             + cts[0].FirstName + ', ' + cts[0].LastName);
			 

Contact[] cts = [SELECT Account.Name FROM Contact 
                 WHERE FirstName = 'Carol' AND LastName='Ruiz'];
Contact carol = cts[0];
String acctName = carol.Account.Name;
System.debug('Carol\'s account name is ' + acctName);
